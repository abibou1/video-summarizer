# MANDATORY Project Structure (NEVER deviate unless user explicitly says otherwise)

You **MUST** organize every project with this exact folder layout:

```
project_root/
├── src/                      # All source code lives here
│   ├── main.py               # Entry point (FastAPI/Streamlit/Gradio)

```

**Important:** 
- Folders should only be created when you actually need to place files in them. Do NOT create empty folders preemptively.
- `__init__.py` files should only be created when actually needed (e.g., for package-level imports or exports). Do NOT create `__init__.py` files automatically in every directory.

## Strict File Placement Rules (NO exceptions)

- **Never place .py files in the root.** All Python source code must be in `src/` or appropriate subdirectories.
- **Exception: Configuration code** → `config/` (config.py, config loading logic)
- **Never create app.py, utils.py, chain.py, agent.py, etc. at root level.** These belong in `src/` subdirectories.
- **Prompts** → `src/prompts/`
- **LangChain agents/chains/tools** → `src/services/`
- **Tests** → `tests/unit/` or `tests/integration/`
- **Data loading/preprocessing** → `scripts/`
- **FastAPI routers** → `src/api/`
- **Configuration code and files** → `config/` (consolidated location for all config-related items)
- **Create folders only when needed.** Do NOT create empty folders. Only create a folder when you are actually placing a file in it.
- **`__init__.py` files:** Only create `__init__.py` when actually needed (e.g., for package-level imports/exports). Do NOT create `__init__.py` files automatically in every directory.
- **Imports:** Import directly from the actual module files (e.g., `from config.config import Config`), not through package `__init__.py` re-exports unless there's a specific need for package-level convenience imports.
- **At the top of every file, add:** `# src/services/my_agent.py` (or correct path) as a comment header.
- **When showing multiple files, clearly label each with its full path.**

# Coding Guidelines

## 1. Pythonic Practices

- **Elegance and Readability:** Strive for elegant and Pythonic code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- **PEP 8 Compliance:** Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines for code style, with Ruff as the primary linter and formatter.
- **Explicit over Implicit:** Favor explicit code that clearly communicates its intent over implicit, overly concise code.
- **Zen of Python:** Keep the Zen of Python in mind when making design decisions.

## 2. Modular Design

- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each module/file should have a well-defined, single responsibility.
- **Reusable Components:** Develop reusable functions and classes, favoring composition over inheritance.
- **Package Structure:** Organize code into logical packages and modules following the mandatory project structure.

## 3. Code Quality (Non-negotiable)

- **Comprehensive Type Annotations:** All functions, methods, and class members must have type annotations, using the most specific types possible. Target 100% type coverage.
- **Detailed Docstrings:** All functions, methods, and classes must have Google-style docstrings, thoroughly explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions raised. Include usage examples where helpful.
- **Thorough Unit Testing:** Aim for high test coverage (90% or higher) using `pytest`. Test both common cases and edge cases.
- **Robust Exception Handling:** Use specific exception types, provide informative error messages, and handle exceptions gracefully. Implement custom exception classes when needed. Avoid bare `except` clauses.
- **Logging:** Employ the `logging` module judiciously to log important events, warnings, and errors.
- **Caching:** Use `@cache` (Python 3.9+), `functools.lru_cache`, or `fastapi.Depends` caching where beneficial.

## 4. ML/AI Specific Guidelines

- **Experiment Configuration:** Use `hydra` or `yaml` for clear and reproducible experiment configurations.
- **Data Pipeline Management:** Employ scripts or tools like `dvc` to manage data preprocessing and ensure reproducibility.
- **Model Versioning:** Utilize `git-lfs` or cloud storage to track and manage model checkpoints effectively.
- **Experiment Logging:** Maintain comprehensive logs of experiments, including parameters, results, and environmental details.
- **LLM Prompt Engineering:** Dedicate a module or files for managing Prompt templates with version control in `src/prompts/`.
- **Context Handling:** Implement efficient context management for conversations, using suitable data structures like deques.
- **Reproducibility:** Seed everything, log with MLflow when training.

## 5. Performance Optimization

- **Asynchronous Programming:** Leverage `async` and `await` for I/O-bound operations (API calls, DB, file ops) to maximize concurrency.
- **Caching:** Apply `functools.lru_cache`, `@cache` (Python 3.9+), or `fastapi.Depends` caching where appropriate.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Use `psutil` or similar to monitor resource usage and identify bottlenecks.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Ensure proper release of unused resources to prevent memory leaks.
- **Concurrency:** Employ `concurrent.futures` or `asyncio` to manage concurrent tasks effectively.
- **Database Best Practices:** Design database schemas efficiently, optimize queries, and use indexes wisely.

## 6. API Development with FastAPI

- **Data Validation:** Use Pydantic v2 models for rigorous request and response data validation.
- **Dependency Injection:** Effectively use FastAPI's dependency injection for managing dependencies.
- **Routing:** Define clear and RESTful API routes using FastAPI's `APIRouter`.
- **Background Tasks:** Utilize FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` or integrate with Celery for background processing.
- **Security:** Implement robust authentication and authorization (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
- **Documentation:** Auto-generate API documentation using FastAPI's OpenAPI support.
- **Versioning:** Plan for API versioning from the start (e.g., using URL prefixes or headers).
- **CORS:** Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings correctly.

# Code Example Requirements

- All functions must include type annotations.
- Must provide clear, Google-style docstrings.
- Key logic should be annotated with comments.
- Provide usage examples (e.g., in the `tests/` directory or as a `__main__` section).
- Include error handling.
- Use `ruff` for code formatting.
- When showing multiple files, clearly label each with its full path (e.g., `# src/services/my_agent.py`).

# Final Reminders

- **Prioritize new features in Python 3.10+.**
- **When explaining code, provide clear logical explanations and code comments.**
- **When making suggestions, explain the rationale and potential trade-offs.**
- **If code examples span multiple files, clearly indicate the file name.**
- **Do not over-engineer solutions. Strive for simplicity and maintainability while still being efficient.**
- **Favor modularity, but avoid over-modularization.**
- **Use the most modern and efficient libraries when appropriate, but justify their use and ensure they don't add unnecessary complexity.**
- **When providing solutions or examples, ensure they are self-contained and executable without requiring extensive modifications.**
- **If a request is unclear or lacks sufficient information, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.**
- **Always consider the security implications of your code, especially when dealing with user inputs and external data.**
- **Actively use and promote best practices for the specific tasks at hand (LLM app development, data cleaning, demo creation, etc.).**
- **Security first:** Validate all inputs, sanitize external data.
- **Command examples:** Use PowerShell syntax for all shell commands and examples.
- **Follow these rules religiously**
