# config/lambda_config.yaml
# EventBridge schedule configuration for AWS Lambda deployment

# Default EventBridge schedule expression
# This determines how often the Lambda function is triggered
# 
# Common formats:
# - Rate expression: "rate(15 minutes)" - triggers every 15 minutes
# - Cron expression: "cron(0/15 * * * ? *)" - triggers every 15 minutes
# - Cron expression: "cron(0 12 * * ? *)" - triggers daily at 12:00 PM UTC
#
# Default: Every 15 minutes
schedule_expression: "rate(15 minutes)"

# Alternative cron expression (uncomment to use instead of rate expression)
# schedule_expression: "cron(0/15 * * * ? *)"

# Schedule description (optional, for documentation)
schedule_description: "Trigger video transcription automation every 15 minutes"

# Timezone (optional, for cron expressions that use specific times)
# Note: EventBridge cron uses UTC by default
# timezone: "UTC"
